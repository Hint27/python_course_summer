# Python Assignment: Summer Class -- Lesson 08

### Instructions:
1. Write comments to explain your code.
2. Use the concepts of sets, operators, conditional statements, and input/output.
3. Ensure your code is well-organized and easy to understand.

### Assignment:

1. **Set Operations:**
   - Create a set called `fruits` with the elements: `"apple"`, `"banana"`, `"cherry"`.
   - Add a new fruit `"orange"` to the `fruits` set.
   - Use the `update()` method to add `"mango"` and `"grape"` to the `fruits` set.
   - Remove `"banana"` from the set using the `remove()` method.
   - Use the `discard()` method to remove `"apple"`, then print the updated set.
   - Create two sets: `set_one = {1, 2, 3, 4}` and `set_two = {3, 4, 5, 6}`. 
   - Find and print the intersection of `set_one` and `set_two`.
   - Find and print the symmetric difference between `set_one` and `set_two`.

2. **Using Operators:**
   - Create two variables, `a = 15` and `b = 10`.
   - Perform the following operations and print the results:
     - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Exponentiation, Floor Division.
   - Use assignment operators to:
     - Add 5 to `a`.
     - Subtract 3 from `b`.
     - Multiply `a` by 2.
     - Divide `b` by 5 and print the rounded result.
   - Compare `a` and `b` using comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) and print the results.

3. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Write a program that asks the user for their age and checks if they are eligible to drive (consider the driving age to be 18).
     - If the user is 18 or older, print `"You are eligible to drive!"`.
     - If the user is younger than 18, print `"You need to wait until you are 18 to drive."`.
   - Write a program that asks the user for their name and checks if it matches your name (use your actual name in the program).
     - If the name matches, print `"Welcome, [Your Name]!"`.
     - If the name doesn't match, print `"Access Denied"`.

4. **Voting Application:**
   - Write a program that asks the user for their name and age.
   - Check if the user is eligible to vote (voting age is 18).
   - If the user is eligible, print `"You are eligible to vote, [Name]!"`.
   - If the user is not eligible, print `"You need to wait until you are 18 to vote."`.
