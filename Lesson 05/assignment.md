# Python Assignment: Summer Class

### Instructions:
1. Write comments to explain your code.
2. Use lists and apply different list methods you have learned.
3. Mimic resetting a list by clearing and re-adding items.

### Assignment:

1. **Favorite Fruits List:**
   - Create a list called `favorite_fruits` with at least 5 different fruits.
   - Use the following methods on your list:
     - `append()` to add a new fruit to the list.
     - `insert()` to add a fruit at the second position.
     - `remove()` to remove a fruit from the list.
     - `pop()` to remove the last fruit from the list and store it in a variable.
   - Print the final list and the fruit that was removed with `pop()`.

2. **Number List Operations:**
   - Create a list called `numbers` with 5 different numbers.
   - Perform the following operations:
     - Use `sort()` to sort the list in ascending order and print the result.
     - Use `reverse()` to reverse the order of the list and print the result.
     - Use `len()` to print the length of the list.
     - Use `sum()` to calculate the sum of the numbers in the list and print the result.

3. **Mimic List Reset:**
   - Create a list called `reset_list` with 4 random items (they can be numbers, strings, or a mix).
   - Use the `clear()` method to remove all items from the list and print the empty list.
   - Mimic resetting the list by adding new items to it using the `append()` method.
   - Print the "reset" list with the new items.
