# Variable Names:
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name
# (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# 1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# 2. A variable name cannot start with a number
# 3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# 4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# 5. A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.


# This is not a valid variable name
#1name = "Umar"
#name-1 = "Mark"
#name 1 = "Samuel"

#THis is valid
name1 = "Isreal"
name2 = "Ebuka"
name3 = "Emmanuel"
name_1 = "John"

# Multi-word variable names
school_name = "Pleasanton School" # Snake case
schoolName = "Albesta Academy" #Camel Case
SchoolName = "Hint Institute" #Pascal Case

print (name1)
