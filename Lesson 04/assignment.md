# Python Assignment: Summer Class

### Instructions:
1. Write comments to explain your code.
2. Use variables and apply the string methods and formatting techniques you have learned.
3. Use f-strings to format your output.

### Assignment:

1. **Message Formatting Program:**
   - Create variables `name`, `age`, and `favorite_quote`.
   - The `name` should be left-aligned using `ljust()`, the `age` should be centered using `center()`, and the `favorite_quote` should be right-aligned using `rjust()`. Use a width of at least 20 characters for each field.
   - Print the formatted message using f-strings.
   - Add an escape character (e.g., `\n` or `\t`) to format the output into separate lines or indented sections.
  
2. **Stripping Extra Spaces Program:**
   - Create a variable `message` that has extra spaces on both sides.
   - Use `lstrip()` to remove leading spaces and print the result.
   - Use `rstrip()` to remove trailing spaces and print the result.
   - Finally, use `strip()` to remove all spaces from both sides and print the result.

3. **Centering a Title:**
   - Create a variable `title` and set it to the name of your favorite book, movie, or hobby.
   - Print the title centered within a string of `*` symbols, making the total width 30 characters using the `center()` method.
